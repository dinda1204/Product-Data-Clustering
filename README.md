# Product-Data-Clustering

This project focuses on implementing clustering methods to group product data based on specific characteristics. The analysis resulted in three main clusters as follows:

    Cluster 0: Premium Products
    High-quality products with higher prices, targeted at exclusive customer segments.

    Cluster 1: Mid-Range Products
    Products offering a balance between quality and price, ideal for customers seeking the best value.

    Cluster 2: Affordable Products
    Budget-friendly products suitable for customers with limited budgets.
